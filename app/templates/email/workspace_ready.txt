2. Go to GitHub ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí SSH Keys:
   https://github.com/settings/ssh/new

3. Click "New SSH key"

4. Paste your SSH key and give it a title like:
   "{{ workspace.subdomain }} - YouAreCoder"

5. Save the key on GitHub

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: You must add this SSH key to your GitHub account before you can clone private repositories (like Odoo Enterprise).
