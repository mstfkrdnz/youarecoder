## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### 1. Database Backup System

**Script:** [backup-database.sh](../../scripts/backup-database.sh)

**Features:**
- Daily automated backups (2:00 AM via cron)
- PostgreSQL pg_dump with compression
- Integrity verification after backup
- 30-day retention policy
- Detailed logging to `/var/log/youarecoder/backup.log`

**Configuration:**
```bash
# Cron job
0 2 * * * /root/youarecoder/scripts/backup-database.sh

# Backup location
/var/backups/youarecoder/database/

# Retention
30 days (automatic cleanup)
```

**Test Results:**
```
‚úÖ Backup created successfully (20251027_092308.sql.gz)
‚úÖ Integrity verification passed
‚úÖ Database contains data (3 companies, 3 users, 3 workspaces)
‚úÖ Cron job configured and active
```

### 2. Database Restore System

**Script:** [restore-database.sh](../../scripts/restore-database.sh)

**Features:**
- Interactive confirmation (safety)
- Pre-restore safety backup
- Automatic application stop/start
- Rollback on failure
- Service health verification

**Safety Measures:**
- Requires explicit "yes" confirmation
- Creates safety backup before restore
- Automatic rollback if restore fails
- Service restart with health check

### 3. Log Rotation

**Flask Application Logs:**
```
/var/log/youarecoder/access.log    # Daily rotation, 30 days retention
/var/log/youarecoder/error.log     # Daily rotation, 30 days retention
/var/log/youarecoder/backup.log    # Weekly rotation, 12 weeks retention
/var/log/youarecoder/restore.log   # Weekly rotation, 12 weeks retention
```

**Traefik Logs:**
```
/var/log/traefik/access.log        # Daily rotation, 14 days, max 100MB
/var/log/traefik/traefik.log       # Daily rotation, 30 days retention
```

**Configuration Files:**
- `/etc/logrotate.d/youarecoder`
- `/etc/logrotate.d/traefik`

**Test Results:**
```
‚úÖ Logrotate configurations validated (no syntax errors)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

### 1. Database Connection Test in Health Check (Non-Critical)

**Issue:**
Health check script reports database connection failure despite Flask app connecting successfully.

**Details:**
```
‚ùå Database: Connection failed!
```

**Root Cause:**
- Environment variable loading in health-check.sh may not properly parse .env file
- Alternative authentication method needed for psql direct connection

**Impact:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è LOW - Does not affect application functionality
- Flask app connects to database successfully
- Only affects health check script's database test

**Workaround:**
- Monitor application logs for actual database issues
- Database is verified working through application testing
- Can be safely ignored or fixed in future iteration

**Proposed Fix (Future):**
```bash
# Use .pgpass file or connection string from app config
# Or test via Flask CLI instead of direct psql
```
