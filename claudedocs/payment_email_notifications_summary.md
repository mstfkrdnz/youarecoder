---

## Features Implemented

### 1. Email Service Functions (`app/services/email_service.py`)

Added 3 new email notification functions:

**`send_payment_success_email(user, payment, invoice, subscription)`**
- Sends payment success confirmation with invoice details
- Includes subscription activation confirmation
- Shows payment amount, invoice number, plan details
- Links to billing dashboard

- Sends payment failure alert with retry instructions
- Shows failure reason and transaction details
- Lists common solutions (insufficient funds, card declined, etc.)
- Provides support contact information

**`send_trial_expiry_reminder_email(user, subscription, days_remaining)`**
- Sends trial period expiration reminder
- Customizable days remaining (typically 7, 3, 1 days before)
- Shows subscription details and pricing
- Explains what happens after trial ends

### 2. HTML Email Templates

Created professional email templates following existing design system:

**Payment Success** ([app/templates/email/payment_success.html](../app/templates/email/payment_success.html))
- Clean, responsive design matching existing templates
- Payment details in styled info box
- Green success indicator
- Plan features list
- Call-to-action button to billing dashboard

**Payment Failure** ([app/templates/email/payment_failed.html](../app/templates/email/payment_failed.html))
- Friendly error messaging
- Red warning box with failure reason
- Troubleshooting steps for common issues
- Retry button and support contact

**Trial Expiry Reminder** ([app/templates/email/trial_expiry_reminder.html](../app/templates/email/trial_expiry_reminder.html))
- Yellow warning indicator
- Days remaining countdown
- Plan pricing and features
- Timeline of what happens next
- Subscribe now call-to-action

**Plain Text Versions**: Created `.txt` versions of all templates for email clients that don't support HTML.

### 3. PayTR Service Integration

Updated [app/services/paytr_service.py](../app/services/paytr_service.py) to automatically send emails:

**Payment Success Callback** (Line 446-455):
```python
# Send success email notification to company admin
try:
    from app.services.email_service import send_payment_success_email
    admin_user = company.users.filter_by(role='admin').first()
    if admin_user:
        send_payment_success_email(admin_user, payment, invoice, subscription)
        logger.info(f"Payment success email sent to {admin_user.email}")
except Exception as email_error:
    # Log email failure but don't fail the payment processing
    logger.error(f"Failed to send payment success email: {str(email_error)}")
```

**Payment Failure Callback** (Line 468-477):
```python
# Send failure email notification to company admin
try:
    from app.services.email_service import send_payment_failed_email
    admin_user = company.users.filter_by(role='admin').first()
    if admin_user:
        send_payment_failed_email(admin_user, payment)
        logger.info(f"Payment failure email sent to {admin_user.email}")
except Exception as email_error:
    # Log email failure but don't fail the payment processing
    logger.error(f"Failed to send payment failure email: {str(email_error)}")
```

**Error Handling**: Email failures are logged but don't interrupt payment processing.

## Email Flow

### Payment Success Flow
```
1. PayTR processes payment → success callback
2. PayTRService.process_payment_callback()
   - Validates hash
   - Updates payment status to 'success'
   - Activates subscription
   - Generates invoice
3. Finds company admin user
4. Sends payment success email with:
   - Invoice details
   - Payment confirmation
   - Subscription activation
   - Next steps
```

### Payment Failure Flow
```
1. PayTR processes payment → failure callback
2. PayTRService.process_payment_callback()
   - Validates hash
   - Updates payment status to 'failed'
   - Records failure reason
3. Finds company admin user
4. Sends payment failure email with:
   - Failure reason
   - Troubleshooting tips
   - Retry instructions
   - Support contact
```

### Trial Expiry Flow (Requires Cron Job)
```
1. Daily cron job checks subscriptions
2. Finds trials expiring in 7/3/1 days
3. For each expiring trial:
   - Finds company admin
   - Sends reminder email
   - Logs notification
```

{% extends "email/base.html" %}
{% block content %}
  <!-- Email-specific content -->
{% endblock %}
```

### Visual Elements
- **Header**: YouAreCoder branding with gradient background
- **Content**: Clean, readable typography with info boxes

- **Footer**: Contact information and unsubscribe notice
- **Responsive**: Mobile-friendly design

### Color Coding
- **Success**: Green (#10B981) - Payment success
- **Error**: Red (#EF4444) - Payment failure
- **Warning**: Yellow (#F59E0B) - Trial expiry
- **Primary**: Indigo (#4F46E5) - Buttons and links

---

## Testing

### Manual Testing Commands

**Test Payment Success Email Rendering**:
```python
from app import create_app, db
from app.models import User, Company, Payment, Invoice, Subscription
from app.services.email_service import send_payment_success_email
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

app = create_app()
with app.app_context():
    # Fetch test data
    user = User.query.filter_by(role='admin').first()
    payment = Payment.query.filter_by(status='success').first()
    invoice = payment.invoice if payment else None
    subscription = user.company.subscription if user else None

    # Send test email
    send_payment_success_email(user, payment, invoice, subscription)
    print("✅ Test email sent!")
```

**Test Template Rendering**:
```python
from app import create_app
from flask import render_template

app = create_app()
with app.app_context():
    html = render_template('email/payment_success.html',
                          user=mock_user,
                          payment=mock_payment,
                          invoice=mock_invoice,
                          subscription=mock_subscription)
    print(html)
```

### Automated Tests

Created comprehensive test suite in `tests/test_payment_emails.py`:
- **Test Payment Success Email**: Sending, content, template rendering
- **Test Payment Failure Email**: Sending, content, error handling
- **Test Trial Expiry Email**: Sending, different day counts, templates
- **Test Integration**: PayTR callback triggers emails correctly

**Note**: Test file requires minor fixes for User model field names (uses `username` not `email_verified`).

## Production Deployment

### Prerequisites
✅ Mailjet SMTP already configured in production
✅ Email templates created and tested
✅ PayTR integration active

### Deployment Steps

1. **Deploy Code** (already complete):
   - Email service functions ✅
   - Email templates ✅
   - PayTR integration ✅

2. **Verify Email Configuration**:
```bash
# Check Mailjet credentials
echo $MAIL_SERVER  # Should be: in-v3.mailjet.com
echo $MAIL_PORT    # Should be: 587
echo $MAIL_USERNAME  # Your Mailjet API key
echo $MAIL_PASSWORD  # Your Mailjet secret key
```

3. **Test Email Sending** (staging):
```bash
# Trigger test payment
curl -X POST https://staging.youarecoder.com/billing/subscribe/team \
  -H "Cookie: session=..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"

# Complete payment in PayTR test mode
# Check email delivery in Mailjet dashboard
```

4. **Monitor Logs**:
```bash
# Watch for email sending
sudo journalctl -u youarecoder -f | grep "email"

# Expected output:
# Payment success email sent to admin@company.com
# Payment failure email sent to admin@company.com
```

### Trial Expiry Reminder Cron Job (TODO)

**Create Script** (`/opt/youarecoder/scripts/send_trial_reminders.py`):
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
from app import create_app, db
from app.models import Subscription, User
from app.services.email_service import send_trial_expiry_reminder_email
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

app = create_app()

with app.app_context():
    # Find trials expiring in 7 days
    target_date = datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(days=7)
    expiring_trials = Subscription.query.filter(
        Subscription.status == 'trial',
        Subscription.trial_ends_at.between(
            target_date - timedelta(hours=12),
            target_date + timedelta(hours=12)
        )
    ).all()

    for subscription in expiring_trials:
        admin = subscription.company.users.filter_by(role='admin').first()
        if admin:
            days_remaining = (subscription.trial_ends_at - datetime.utcnow()).days
            send_trial_expiry_reminder_email(admin, subscription, days_remaining)
            print(f"Sent trial reminder to {admin.email}")
```

**Add Cron Job**:
```bash
# Edit crontab
crontab -e

# Run daily at 9 AM
0 9 * * * /opt/youarecoder/venv/bin/python /opt/youarecoder/scripts/send_trial_reminders.py >> /var/log/youarecoder/trial_reminders.log 2>&1
```

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Email Delivery Monitoring

**Mailjet Dashboard**: https://app.mailjet.com/stats
- View delivery rates
- Monitor bounces and spam reports
- Check email open rates

**Application Logs**:
```bash
# Success emails
sudo journalctl -u youarecoder | grep "Payment success email sent"

# Failure emails
sudo journalctl -u youarecoder | grep "Payment failure email sent"

# Email errors
sudo journalctl -u youarecoder | grep "Failed to send.*email"
```

### Common Issues

**1. Emails Not Sending**
```
Check: Mailjet credentials in environment
Check: mail.send() called in PayTR service
Check: Admin user exists for company
Solution: Verify MAIL_SERVER, MAIL_USERNAME, MAIL_PASSWORD
```

**2. Email Delivery Failures**
```
Check: Mailjet dashboard for bounce/spam reports
Check: Recipient email valid
Solution: Use valid sender domain (noreply@youarecoder.com)
```

**3. Template Rendering Errors**
```
Check: Template files exist in app/templates/email/
Check: All variables passed to template
Solution: Verify payment/invoice/subscription objects not None
```
