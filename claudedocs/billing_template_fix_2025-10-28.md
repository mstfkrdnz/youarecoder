# Billing Template Fix - Property vs Method - 2025-10-28

## Issue
Billing page showed "Error loading billing information" error.

**Error in logs:**
```
TypeError: 'str' object is not callable
File "/root/youarecoder/app/templates/billing/dashboard.html", line 282
{{ invoice.amount_display() }}
```

## Root Cause

### Model Definition:
In `app/models.py`, we added `Invoice.amount_display` as a `@property`:

```python
class Invoice(db.Model):
    # ... fields ...

    @property
    def amount_display(self):
        """Get formatted amount for display (alias for total_display)."""
        return self.total_display()
```

### Template Usage:
Template was calling it as a **method** (with parentheses):
```jinja2
{{ invoice.amount_display() }}  ‚ùå WRONG - property doesn't use ()
```

Should be called as a **property** (without parentheses):
```jinja2
{{ invoice.amount_display }}  ‚úÖ CORRECT - property access
```

## Fix Applied

### File: `/root/youarecoder/app/templates/billing/dashboard.html`

**Line 282 - Changed:**
```jinja2
<!-- Before -->
{{ invoice.amount_display() }}

<!-- After -->
{{ invoice.amount_display }}
```

**Note:** `payment.amount_display()` remains unchanged on line 211 because `Payment.amount_display` is still a **method** (not a property).

## Difference: Property vs Method

### Payment Model (Method - needs parentheses):
```python
class Payment(db.Model):
    def amount_display(self):  # Regular method
        """Get formatted amount for display."""
        symbol = '$' if self.currency == 'USD' else '‚Ç∫'
        return f"{symbol}{self.amount / 100:.2f}"
```
**Template usage:** `{{ payment.amount_display() }}` ‚úÖ

### Invoice Model (Property - no parentheses):
```python
class Invoice(db.Model):
    @property  # Decorator makes it a property
    def amount_display(self):
        """Get formatted amount for display (alias for total_display)."""
        return self.total_display()
```
**Template usage:** `{{ invoice.amount_display }}` ‚úÖ

## Deployment

**Command executed:**
```bash
sed -i 's/invoice\.amount_display()/invoice.amount_display/g' \
    /root/youarecoder/app/templates/billing/dashboard.html

systemctl restart youarecoder
```
