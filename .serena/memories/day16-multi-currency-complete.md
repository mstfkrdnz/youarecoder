## Technical Implementation Summary

### Multi-Currency Feature (Completed Previously)
**Configuration:**
- SUPPORTED_CURRENCIES = ['TRY', 'USD', 'EUR']
- DEFAULT_CURRENCY = 'TRY'
- Pricing: Starter (₺870/$29/€27), Team (₺2,970/$99/€92), Enterprise (₺8,970/$299/€279)

**Database:**
- Migration: migrations/multi_currency.sql
- Column: preferred_currency VARCHAR(3)
- Constraint: CHECK (preferred_currency IN ('TRY', 'USD', 'EUR'))

**Backend:**
- app/models.py: preferred_currency field added
- app/services/paytr_service.py: Currency validation and price lookup
- app/routes/billing.py: Currency parameter handling

**Frontend:**
- app/templates/billing/dashboard.html: Currency selector with flags
- JavaScript: switchCurrency() function for dynamic price updates
- CSS: Active button styling (blue background, white text)

**Bug Fixed:**
- Issue: dataset.priceTry not working (wrong case)
- Root Cause: HTML data-price-try → JavaScript requires camelCase (priceTry)
- Fix: Proper camelCase conversion in JavaScript
- Commit: c7ec0f2
- Status: All currencies working perfectly

## Session Workflow

1. **User Request 1:** "Testi tekrarlar mısın?" (Can you repeat the test?)
   - Executed E2E test with Playwright MCP
   - Validated all 3 currencies in production
   - Captured screenshots for evidence
   - Results: 100% pass rate (6/6 tests)

2. **User Request 2:** "daily raporumuzu oluşturalım, master planı güncelleyelim ve bugünü kaydedelim"
   - Created comprehensive daily report (638 lines)
   - Updated master plan with Day 16 section
   - Committed and pushed to git
   - Session save with Serena MCP

## Key Learnings

### Technical Insights
1. **Dataset API:** HTML data attributes require camelCase conversion in JavaScript
2. **E2E Testing:** Playwright MCP excellent for production validation with screenshots
3. **Currency Switching:** Client-side switching provides instant UX (<50ms)
4. **PayTR Limitation:** Multi-currency display works, but payments processed in TRY only (requires merchant multi-currency account)

### Process Insights
1. **Documentation Timing:** Creating daily reports immediately after work captures all details
2. **Test Validation:** Re-running tests after bug fixes confirms resolution
3. **Session Lifecycle:** /sc-load → Work → Documentation → /sc-save pattern works well
4. **Git Workflow:** Comprehensive commit messages provide excellent project history
